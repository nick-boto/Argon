# Argon
Argon is a mod for the Battle of Polytopia. It was made using the PolyMod mod API, and requires the PolyMod launcher to run.
Argon is primarily a rebalancing mod, but it also serves the purpose of sprinkling in unused features that were lost over the development of Polytopia.

## Features
 - Cloaks have gained the Convert ability, but have lost their 1 point of defence and the Scout ability
 - Swordsmen (now called Soldiers) have gained the Heal ability for balancing purposes
 - Mind Benders (now called Mages) have lost the Convert ability in favour of a ranged, magical, splash damage attack and AOE healing when they move
 - Free Spirit is now a T1 tech, with its branches being Roads/Trade and Strategy/Diplomacy
 - Riding is now a T2 tech, branching from Organization and leading to Chivalry
 - 
 - Every tribe gets a starting resource, of which two are guaranteed to spawn in its capital
 - Ai-Mo starts with a Mage
 - Aquarion starts with Riding

## Credits
Most everything was done by me, except for...
 - The Discipline icon, which was taken from [PolyPlus](https://github.com/johnklipi/PolyPlus/releases/tag/v1.2.1), another PolyMod
 - The tribe starting stars and main menu background code, which was taken from The Enhanced Polyxperience, another PolyMod
Heavy inspiration was also taken from these mods, as well as a third called General Rework.
